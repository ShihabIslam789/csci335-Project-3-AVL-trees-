# csci335-Project-3-AVL-trees-

# Project Premise
The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with lists and trees and compare the performance of the self-balancing AVL tree. <br>
You will also work with a real-world data set and construct a generic test routine for comparing several different implementations of the tree <br>
container class. You are encouraged to use the bookâ€™s implementation for AVL trees. <br>

# Files given
avl_tree.h, query_tree.cc, test_tree.cc, test_tree_mod.cc, dsexceptions.h, <br>
a README.txt, a Makefile and more text (.txt) files. <br>
